\usage{
hitype_assign_level(
  clusters,

  fallback = "Unknown",
  threshold = 0.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clusters}{A named vector of original cluster assignments
(names - cell names, values - cluster assignments)}

\item{hitype_scores}{A list of matrices of cell type scores for each level}

\item{fallback}{A fallback cell type if no cell type is assigned}

\item{threshold}{A threshold for low confidence cell type assignment
The cell types are only assigned for cells with scores higher than the
threshold * ncells.
(0 - 1, default 0.25)}
